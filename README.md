# Docsalike

Docsalike is a Google Docs clone built with Next.js, Tailwind and Firebase.

In docsalike users can create and edit rich text documents to take notes. They can access the service from any of their devices. The documents save automatically so there's never need to press "save" again. Users can easily manage their documents by creating new, copying existing ones or deleting their old ones.

## Tech Stack

Built with TypeScript, React and Next.js. Authentication, database and backend are done with Firebase.

The user interface is styled with Tailwind CSS which is optimised with PostCSS. Document editing is made possible by Draft.js.

Deployment is done with Netlify utilising Lighthouse, Essential Next.js and A11y plugins.
